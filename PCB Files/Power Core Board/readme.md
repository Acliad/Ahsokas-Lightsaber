This board contains all the control and driver circuitry for the lightsaber's power core. The original prototype was built with an [Adafruit RP2040 Prop-Maker Feather](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-rp2040-prop-maker-feather/overview?gad_source=1&gbraid=0AAAAADx9JvSYvroxZ-rMhNv60DHCdfj1e&gclid=Cj0KCQjwgL-3BhDnARIsAL6KZ68s_8NPtJWohHZQhYD6guZvRnboexCSJRLxrmSgvO_vFlvhVqaqsGYaAtTnEALw_wcB). This board is designed to have the same outline and generally accomplish the same feature set. The primary functional differences are this Power Core board:

- Uses an STM32L4 instead of a RP2040
- Uses a 6-axis IMU instead of a 3-axis accelerometer
- Contains a 5V boost converter to power the LEDs at full brightness across battery voltage

## Requirements
The Power Core board main requirements are:

- Contains >= 100MB of onboard storage
- Powered from a single-cell lithium-ion battery
    - Battery connector compatible with JST-PH
- USB-C charging and power from USB-C when connected
- USB-C data connection to the MCU
- 6-axis IMU for motion detection
- 5V boost converter to power the LEDs at full brightness across battery voltage
- 3.3V regulator to power the MCU and connected peripherals
- ~3W audio amplifier
- Terminal block for easy connection to the LED strip and speaker
- EN pin to enable/disable to put device into very low power shutdown mode
- Measurement of battery voltage
